    Open the Jupyter Notebook Investigate_a_dataset.ipynb to see the analysis process.

Data Wrangling

The data wrangling process includes:

    Loading the data and inspecting its general properties.
    Checking for duplicate appointments and patients.
    Handling missing values and correcting data types.
    Cleaning the dataset by removing unnecessary columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis includes visualizations and insights into various aspects of the data, such as:

    Age distribution of patients who show up or miss appointments.
    Relationship between age and chronic diseases.
    Influence of gender on appointment attendance.
    Effect of receiving SMS reminders on attendance.
    Impact of neighborhood on attendance rates.

Conclusion

Neighborhood, age, and receiving SMS reminders are identified as important factors influencing appointment attendance. However, no clear correlation is found between attendance and gender or chronic diseases.
Limitations

    The analysis is based on a specific dataset and may not be fully generalizable to other contexts.
    The dataset may have limitations or biases.
    The conclusions drawn are based on exploratory analysis and correlation, not causation.
